      <p>You can bend creatures of the wild to your will. Whenever a beast or monstrosity that is charmed by you makes a saving throw to end the charmed condition, you can use a reaction to shout at that creature and subtract your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) from the result of its saving throw.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can also command the monsters you tame. Any beast or monstrosity charmed by you acts during your turn for the duration of that charm effect. If you are within 30 feet of the creature and it can hear you, you can use a bonus action to order it to take one of the actions from its stat block.</p>

      <p>While most Rangers have some skill with animals, those who pursue the life of a Wrangler are true masters at taming wild beasts. Drawing upon their intimate understanding of animal behavior, they tame and guide all sorts of fantastical animals. Rugged and wild, Wranglers are always on the hunt for ever more strange and exotic creatures to tame and befriend.</p>
