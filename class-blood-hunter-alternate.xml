    <description>
      <p>When the young man's blindfold was removed he found himself in a dimly lit room surrounded by hooded figures. He stood in front of a small dais that held a vial of gleaming crimson liquid. Months of training had led him to this moment. If he survived drinking the vial, the Hunter's Bane, he would never be the same. Becoming more than human, he would finally have the power to avenge his family that lay dead all these years.</p>
      <p class="indent">As the horde of demonic spawn lurched toward her, the aging half-elf ran her thin blade along her palm, coating it in her blood. In an instant, the blood ignited, wreathing her sword in a ghastly blue flame. She fell upon the horde as a blur of azure fire and cold steel. The hellspawn would find no mercy from her today.</p>
      <p class="indent">In the light of the pale moon, an almost feral halfling got down on all fours to sniff the tracks before him. The scent of goblin was unmistakable, vile rags and rotten meats. With a bestial howl, the halfling grew in size and wiry gray fur burst forth from his arms and legs. As fast as the wind, the halfling werewolf began another hunt in the light of the full moon.</p>
      <p class="indent">All of the strange and monstrous warriors described above are Blood Hunters, occult guardians who infect and inoculate their blood with accursed power so they may hunt monsters.</p>
      <h4>SELF-SACRIFICING HUNTERS</h4>
      <p>Blood Hunters have no formal hierarchy and their Orders are as varied as the curses they choose to bear, but they do hold one thing in common, the Hunter's Bane. Those who survive this ancient and deadly ritual are able to wield the signature sanguine magic that marks them as Blood Hunters.</p>
      <p class="indent">The makeup of this sinister ritual varies by Order and era, with each incorporating monstrous curses and magic which grant a Blood Hunter the unique abilities of their Order. This ritual permanently changes the subject, inoculating its blood with monstrous power at the expense of what makes them a normal mortal. Wherever monsters lurk, there also are Blood Hunters who have given up their chance at a mundane life so they may stalk and slay the vile creatures of darkness.</p>
      <h4>ANCIENT AND SINISTER RITES</h4>
      <p>Wherever creatures of the darkness prowl, there are warriors who stand against them. Many Orders of Blood Hunters can trace their lineage back to ancient days. The blood magic they use is older than the divine magic of Clerics, and it serves as the legacy of dark times when mortals were forced to fend for themselves. Though their blood magic is unsettling and grim in nature, many Blood Hunters place a great deal of pride in the ancient traditions, rituals, and rites of their Occult Order.</p>
      <h4>CREATING YOUR BLOOD HUNTER</h4>
      <p>When creating a Blood Hunter, the most important thing to consider is why they would choose this accursed way of life. Were they the victim of a horrible monster attack and swore vengeance, no matter the personal cost? Were they trained from birth under the tutelage of an elder hunter, and forged into a relentless monster slayer? Or, were they recruited by a secretive society for their exceptional talent at hunting?</p>

      <p>At 2nd level, you learn to harness the sinister magicks within your bloodstream to invoke the ancient power of Blood Rites:</p>
      <h5>BLOOD RITES KNOWN</h5>
      <p>At 2nd level, you know two Blood Rites of your choice from the list at the end of this class. When you reach certain Blood Hunter levels you learn more Rites of your choice, as shown in the Rites Known column of the Blood Hunter class table.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once you invoke a Blood Rite you must finish a short or long rest before you can invoke that Blood Rite again. When you have no uses of a Blood Rite remaining, you can make a Vital Sacrifice (detailed below) to use that Rite again.</p>
      <p class="indent">Blood Rites can only be used against creatures with blood. However, when you make a Vital Sacrifice to empower a Rite, you can target any creature, regardless if it has blood or not.</p>
      <p class="indent">Finally, whenever you learn a new Blood Rite, you can replace one of the Blood Rites you know with  another Rite of your choice.</p>
      <h5>RITE DIE</h5>
      <p>Some Blood Rites use your Rite Die, which starts as a d4. At certain Blood Hunter levels, this die grows, as shown in the Rite Die column of the Blood Hunter class table.</p>
      <h5>VITAL SACRIFICE</h5>
      <p>Some Blood Rites allow you to sacrifice your own life to fuel deadly effects. When you make a Vital Sacrifice, you reduce both your maximum and current hit points by one roll of your Rite Die. This reduction cannot be lessened in any way.</p>
      <p class="indent">If you have temporary hit points, you can reduce these in place of reducing your current hit points. You always reduce your maximum hit points when you make a Vital Sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="indent">At the end of your next long rest, any reductions to your maximum hit points from Vital Sacrifices return to normal.</p>
      <h5>SAVING THROWS</h5>
      <p>If a Blood Rite requires a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you use your Rite save DC, as shown below:</p>
      <center>
        <p><strong>Rite save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constituion modifier.</p>
      </center>

    <description>
      <p>Blood Hunters who join the dark Order of Witch Knights are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These benefactors offer power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.</p>

      <p>The bargain you have struck with your Patron has granted you the ability to cast spells, much like a Warlock does:</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>You learn two Cantrips of your choice from the Witch Knight spell list. Upon reaching 13th level in this class you learn one additional Witch Knight Cantrip of your choice.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of your Witch Knight spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Witch Knight spells of 1st-level or higher. Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than the level in the table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a Blood Hunter level, you can choose one Witch Knight spell you know and replace it with another Witch Knight spell of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Witch Knight spells. You use your Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
