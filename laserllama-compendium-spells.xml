An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist this effect, but shapechangers automatically succeed on their saving throw. This spell has no affect on a target that has 0 hit points. The transformation lasts for the duration, but it ends early if the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.</p>

      <p class="indent">The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it was transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. If this excess damage reduces its normal form to 0 hit points, it is knocked unconscious.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Actions.</i></b> The actions the creature can take are limited to those its new form is able to perform. It cannot speak, cast spells, or take any actions that require hands or speech.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Equipment.</i></b> Its clothing, weapons, armor, and objects it is holding meld into the new form. However, it can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You conjure a blade of pure negative energy in your empty hand and make one melee weapon attack against a creature within your reach, attempting to behead it. On hit, it takes force damage equal to 6d8 + your spellcasting modifier.</p>
      <p class="indent">If this damage reduces the creature to 50 hit points or fewer, you instantly cut off one of its heads of your choice</p>
      <p class="indent">The creature instantly dies if it cannot survive without the lost head. The creature's head is not removed if it is immune to slashing damage, or if it doesn't have or need a head.</p>

    <supports>Magus, Wizard</supports>
    <description>
      <p>A shimmering opaque wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range and lasts for the duration.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Orientation.</i></b> The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or an angle. It can be free floating or rest on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome, a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. Nothing can pass through the wall physically, and anything viewed through it is lightly obscured. The wall extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. If it cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it chooses which side of the wall it moves to. On a failure, you choose the side it moves to.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Statistics.</i></b> The wall has 150 hit points and its Armor Class equals your Spell save DC. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a <em>dispel magic</em> spell, but a <em>disintegrate</em> spell destroys the wall it instantly.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the hit points of the wall created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 5th.</p>

      <p>You psionically overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 12d6 psychic damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t stunned.</p>
      <p class="indent">The stunned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>

      <p>A shimmering, immobile, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area of your choice within range. You choose whether this magic prison is shaped like a cage with bars or a solid box.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Shape.</i></b> If you choose cage, it can be up to 20 feet on a side and made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. If you choose box, it can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out of the area. The cage extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Creatures Inside.</i></b> When you cast the spell, any creatures that are completely inside the area of the cage are trapped. Any creatures partially within the area, or too large to fit are pushed away until they are completely outside of the cage.</p>
      <p class="indent">A creature inside the cage cannot leave it by non-magical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. The spell or effect is wasted on a failed save, but on a success the creature uses the spell or effect to escape.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Statistics.</i></b> The cage's Armor Class equals your Spell save DC and it has 200 hit points. It is immune to poison, psychic, and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, vulnerable to force and magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and resistant to all other damage types. It cannot be dispelled by a dispel magic spell, but a disintegrate spell destroys the cage it instantly.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the hit points of the cage created by this spell increase by 25 for each spell slot level above 7th.</p>
