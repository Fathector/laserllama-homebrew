      <p>You combine your primal instincts with your monastic training to reach your true savage potential. You gain one of the disciplines below. Once chosen it cannot be changed:</p>
      <h5 class="caption">BESTIAL FURY</h5>
      <p>When you score a critical hit against a creature with an unarmed strike, its movement speed is instantly reduced to 0, and you have advantage on any unarmed strikes that you make against that creature until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">NATURAL RESILIENCE</h5>
      <p>You can draw on your wellspring of mystic power to harden your defenses and shrug off assaults. Whenever a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can expend ki points (up to your Wisdom modifier) to reduce the damage by one roll of your martial arts die for each ki point spent.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">SAVAGE RUSH</h5>
      <p>You can channel a burst of primal speed to trample those in your path. As an action, you can spend 4 ki points and move up to your full walking speed in a straight line, and force any creature you pass through to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure they take bludgeoning damage equal to four rolls of your martial arts die and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half as much damage and are not knocked prone.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You have created a signature Heroic Persona, a larger- than-life identity that can include a set of light or medium armor and a shield. As a bonus action, so long as you can't be seen, you can instantly don your Heroic Persona, which grants you temporary hit points equal to your monk level, in addition to granting you the benefits listed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
        <li>When you hit with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal an additional 1d10 damage to the target.</li>
        <li>You can use your Wisdom, in place of Dexterity, when calculating your Armor Class in light or medium armor.</li>
        <li>Ability checks and divination spells that would discern your true identity automatically fail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">The effects of your Heroic Persona last for 1 hour, and end early if you use your bonus action to end it. Once you adopt your Heroic Persona you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to don your Heroic Persona again.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You learn ancient monastic arts that allow you to cast spells:</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Four Elements spell list at the end of this Tradition. You learn one additional Four Elements cantrip at 10th and 17th level.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Four Elements Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast a Four Elements spell of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You use the spell's casting time and other rules, but your body is the spellcasting focus for these spells, and you don't need to provide any material components. You regain expended Four Elements spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, at 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell burning hands, you must spend one of these Four Elements slots, and you cast it at 2nd-level.</p>
      <h5>KI CASTING</h5>
      <p>You can draw upon your ki to regain your elemental powers. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a number of ki points equal to 1 + your Slot Level to regain one of your expended Four Elements spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Four Elements spell list at the end of this Tradition. The Spells Known column of the Four Elements Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Slot Level column for your level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a monk level, you can choose one Four Elements spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Four Elements spell list, which must be of a level for which you have Four Elements spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Four Elements spells, so you use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting a saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
