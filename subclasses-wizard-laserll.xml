      <p>While almost all wizards study in formal schools under the tutelage of a wise master, some wizards reject traditional arcane schooling and strike out into the world to learn by doing. These rare few who hone their craft out in the wilds are referred to as Hedge Wizards. Though their methods are frowned upon by formal wizarding schools, any archmage worthy of his station will reluctantly recognize that Hedge Wizards are the true masters of the low magics.</p>
      <p class="indent">Regardless of their background, all Hedge Wizards reject the traditional methods of wizardry. When creating your Hedge Wizard consider how your spellcasting and spellbook may differ from a wizard who attended a formal school</p>

To preserve their power, most wizards learn to cast ritual spells, spells that take longer to produce, but aren't as draining on said wizard's magical stamina.

			<p>You have learned to perform arcane rituals not normally known to wizards. At 2nd level, you add two 1st-level ritual spells of your choice from any spell list to your spellbook. In addition, you can copy ritual spells from any class's spell list into your spellbook, though you must otherwise follow the normal rules for copying these spells into your spellbook.</p>
      <p class="indent">Any non-wizard spell you add to your spellbook with this feature counts as wizard spell for you, but you can only cast it as a ritual, unless you've learned it by some other means.</p>

Wizards that pursue the art of alchemy are experts at combining exotic ingredients to produce a variety of arcane effects.

With access to the right reagents, and a bit of luck, students of alchemy use their wondrous Arcane Elixirs aid their allies and leech life away from their enemies.</p>

      <p>Also at 2nd level, you learn to channel divine energy directly from the upper planes, and use it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such Channel Divinity effect: Turn Undead.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once you use your Channel Divinity to produce one of the divine effects you know, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use any of your Channel Divinities again.</p>
      <p class="indent">If one of your Channel Divinity effects requires a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your wizard spell save DC.</p>
      <p class="indent">Should you find a scroll, tome, or a willing teacher, you can copy additional Channel Divinities into your spellbook. To do so, you must spend 100 gold on blessed inks and parchment and spend 8 hours copying the prayers into your spellbook.</p>
