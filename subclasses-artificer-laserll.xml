      <p>One of the most dangerous obsessions an artificer can pursue has always been mechanical flight. Many strive for this lofty goal, and all but the most dedicated, and often the most foolhardy, artificers fail in their pursuits. Experiments that end in disastrous explosions, catastrophic falls from the sky, and deadly malfunctions are not out of the norm for an Aeronaut perfecting their mechanical flying machine.</p>
      <p class="indent">You constantly strive to achieve the lofty goal of every Aeronaut, the creation of an arcane flying machine.</p>

      <p>For centuries chroniclers have sought the best way to store vast amounts of information. Where most are satisfied with scrolls, Archivists strove for something greater. They have learned to store libraries worth of information in a single object, awakening the first Artificial Minds. Working in tandem with these wondrous Minds, Archivists wield the potentially limitless power of these arcane intelligences.</p>

      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you learn to awaken Artificial Minds within objects. At the end of a long rest, you can touch a Tiny, non-magical object, and use your calligrapher's supplies to awaken an Artificial Mind within it. While the Artificial Mind is awakened within an object, it is considered a magic item that requires attunement, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. If you attempt to rouse a second Artificial Mind while you already have one from this feature, the first Artificial Mind ceases to exist. While attuned to your Artificial Mind, you gain the following abilities:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Information Overload.</em></b> You can cause your Artificial Mind to overload the mind's of your foes by channeling information at them. As an action, you can force a creature that you can see within 30 feet to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage and disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent">The damage of Information Overload increases when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Magical Telepathy.</em></b> You can communicate telepathically with any creature carrying one of your infused items within a 1-mile radius. The creature can respond telepathically.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Skill Proficiencies.</em></b> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from the column on the Artificial Mind table. The material of the object determines the skills you choose from, as the object's nature affects the mind's knowledge.</p>

      <p>You can use your understanding of Biomancy magic to create an aberrant life form. Starting at 3rd level, whenever you cast find familiar, you instead create a Chimera, which functions as a normal familiar, but has the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The material component is 1 pound of organic matter.</li>
        <li>It is a monstrosity (instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend).</li>
        <li>It has additional hit points equal to your artificer level.</li>
        <li>As an action, the Chimera can touch a creature and sacrifice any amount of its hit points, healing the target for the same amount by grafting its flesh to theirs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="indent">As an action, the Chimera can merge with a creature it can touch, granting it temporary hit points equal to the Chimera's remaining hit points. While merged, the target gains one of the Chimeric Traits below. The creatures remain merged until you create another Chimera, or the temporary hit points are depleted, at which point the Chimera is destroyed.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Amphibious Physiology.</em></b> While merged, the creature can breathe both air and water, and gains a 30 foot swim speed.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Resilient Hide.</em></b>While merged and not wearing any armor or using a shield, the creature's Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier + their Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p>You have improved your Chronometer so that you can literally save moments in time for later. Beginning at 5th level, when you successfully paralyze, stun, or reduce a creature's movement speed to 0 with a spell or Chronothief ability, your Chronometer regains one of its expended charges.</p>
      <p class="indent">Also, any of your Chronometer abilities that require an action to use can also be used as a bonus action on your turn.</p>

      <p>Your understanding and control over the magic of time has greatly increased. Upon reaching 9th level in this class, the magic of your Chronometer improves in the following ways:</p>
      <p class="indent">You can only have one Chronometer at a time, and creating another causes the magic within the first to dissipate.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your Chronometer has a number of charges equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. It regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. While your Chronometer is in hand, you can expend a charge to use the following abilities:</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Accelerate.</em></b> Opportunity attacks against the target creature have disadvantage until the end of their next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Decelerate.</em></b> You can spend an additional charge to double the movement speed reduction. If this feature reduces a target's speed to 0, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><em>Slip.</em></b> You can spend two charges to use this reaction after you know if the triggering attack roll, ability check, or saving throw succeeded or failed.</p>
