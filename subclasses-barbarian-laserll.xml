    <description>
      <p>When you adopt this Primal Path, you learn to channel the primal power of spirits to cast spells, much like a Shaman.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Warden spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional Warden cantrip of your choice.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Warden Primal Magic table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of the Warden spells you know of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all of your expended spell slots each time you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, when you are 7th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <em>thunderwave</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warden spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warden spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can choose a warden spell you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p class="indent">When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new Warden spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>As you draw your magic from your connection to primal spirits, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells. You use Wisdom when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a spell, or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
