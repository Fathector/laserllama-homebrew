      <p>Worship takes on many forms across the multiverse; the quiet contemplation of the monastic hermit, the insightful guidance of the temple priest, the resolute dedication of the faith-filled zealot, and the impassioned preacher spreading the tenants of their faith across the land with word and song.</p>
      <p class="indent">Bards of the College of Radiance are devout preachers of the divine, and all their performances sing the praise of their deity. These bards use the power of their voice to further the will of their god and inspire devotion in their followers.</p>

      <p>Your deity has blessed you with a measure of their divine power in return for your service. Choose a Divine Domain from those available to the Cleric that best fits the deity you serve. Whenever you learn a new Bard spell, you can choose from the Bard spell list, the Cleric spell list, or your list of Domain Spells, and the spell becomes a Bard spell for you. You must obey all other rules from learning a new spell.</p>
