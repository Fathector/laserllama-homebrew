      <p>While most Paladins are known for the wrath they pour out upon their foes, those who swear the Oath of the shield use their power to defend. Known as Divine Shields, these noble warriors stand as protectors of the innocent and defenseless. Bravely placing themselves between their allies and danger, a Divine Shield is an invaluable ally to have on the battlefield.</p>
