    <description>
      <p>As the aging man struggled to keep up with his companions, he started to regret his decision to join the young adventurers. His days of glory had long passed, but hearing the poorly devised plan of the aspiring heroes had rekindled something inside his soul that he thought gone forever. The old man couldn't use a sword like he used to, but if his young companions took his advice, they may yet be able to survive the dangerous life an adventure for a few days.</p>
      <p class="indent">The dwarven lord ordered his soldiers to form ranks as the uncountable horde of horrors poured forth from the tunnel ahead. He positioned his platoon of elite warriors in the final tunnel before the entrance of his clan's great city. His clan had delved too greedily and they had freed something from the depths below. The lord muttered a final prayer and prepared to lead his men to their deaths, hopefully giving the rest of his clan time to escape the unstoppable horde of monstrosities.</p>
      <p class="indent">A lithe wood elf quietly led her hunting party through the underbrush of the great wood. They had tracked their foe, a great two-headed troll, for almost two days. As it rested in a clearing, she gave the signal and her fellow hunters fanned out around the beast, blending in with the natural landscape. On her mark, the hunting party lunged forward with their spears, and the troll was felled before it could react.</p>
      <p class="indent">All of these warriors are considered Warlords, martial leaders who use their knowledge of tactics and warfare to empower their allies and thwart the plans of their foes.</p>
      <h4>DECISIVE LEADERS</h4>
      <p>While Warlords are as varied as styles of leadership, they all share one thing in common: a commitment to their decisions. Once a true Warlord decides on a course of action, whether it was their idea or not, they will see the plan through to its end.</p>
      <p class="indent">These natural-born leaders stand as stalwart figures in the face of danger and can rally their allies to overcome whatever obstacles may stand between them and their goals. Though they are not always formally appointed leaders, the presence of a Warlord, both on and off the field of battle, can motivate any who follow them to be the best version of themselves.</p>
      <h4>FROM MANY, ONE</h4>
      <p>Alone, a Warlord is a minor threat, but with loyal companions to organize and command, the greatest Warlords are capable of toppling empires. Known for their keen use of tactics and knowledge of warfare, a Warlord is able to draw out the true potential of their allies. Leaders to their core, a Warlord will make sure to understand the capabilities and weaknesses of their allies so they can help them to reach their true potential.</p>
      <p class="indent">These exceptional strategists are able to step back and allow their allies to excel in combat. Though they are able to hold their own in battle, a warlord's true strength lies in the potent orders they issue to their allies. These insights push their comrades from mundane warriors to true heroes.</p>
      <h4>CREATING YOUR WARLORD</h4>
      <p>When creating your Warlord, consider where they learned to be a leader. Did they serve as the squire of a world-renowned general? Were they the star pupil of their kingdom's military academy? Or, did they slowly rise through the bloody ranks of a band of mercenaries, learning to lead through necessity?</p>
      <p class="indent">Also, consider why your Warlord would lead others rather than improve their own individual martial skill. Do they see value in teamwork and coordination? Does their age or some other impairment prevent them from fighting on their own? Have they always had a sharp mind and a knack for leading others, maybe even from a young age?</p>
      <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a Warlord quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Dexterity or Strength your highest ability score, followed by Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence, depending on your Leadership Style. Second, take the noble background.</p>

      <p>The Warlord table shows the number of Exploit Dice you have to perform any Tactical Exploits you know. Some Exploits require you to expend these Exploit Dice in order to use them. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw. You regain all expended Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your Exploit Dice begin as d4s and increase in size as you gain Warlord levels, as indicated in the Warlord table.</p>
      <h5>EXPLOITS KNOWN</h5>
      <p>You know two Tactical Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this class description. The Exploits Known column of the Warlord table shows when you learn more Exploits. To learn an Exploit you must meet any prerequisites it may have, like a minimum Ability Score or a certain Warlord level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a Warlord level, you can replace one of the Exploits you know with a Tactical Exploit of your choice.</p>
      <h5>SAVING THROWS</h5>
      <p>If one of your Tactical Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit save DC is calculated as follows:</p>
      <center>
        <p><strong>Exploit save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Leadership modifier</p>

      <p>Your talent in poetry and music allows you to produce spells, much like the Bard does. You gain the following benefits:</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Skald Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the thunderwave spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast thunderwave using either spell slot.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Skald Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Bard spells of your choice of 1st-level or higher. Any Bard spell you learn through this feature must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Bard Spell List. The spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use any musical instrument you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells. Skalds are known for using one-handed instruments, like war horns, while holding a weapon in their other hand.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>You use your Leadership modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for any Bard spells you know through this feature.</p>
      <center>
        <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Leadership modifier</p>

      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Skald Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the thunderwave spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast thunderwave using either spell slot.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Skald Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Bard spells of your choice of 1st-level or higher. Any Bard spell you learn through this feature must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Bard Spell List. The spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use any musical instrument you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells. Skalds are known for using one-handed instruments, like war horns, while holding a weapon in their other hand.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>You use your Leadership modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for any Bard spells you know through this feature.</p>
      <center>
        <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Leadership modifier</p>
        <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Leadership modifier</p>
