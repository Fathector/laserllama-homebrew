        <description>
          <p>You are compiling a Cook Book which contains the exotic Recipes you discover during your adventures:</p>
          <p class="indent"><strong><em>Recipes Known.</em></strong>You know two Recipes of your choice from the list at the end of this Discipline.</p>
          <p class="indent"><strong><em>Adding a Recipe.</em></strong>As an action, you can harvest a Sample from a creature that died within the last minute. Before the end of your next long rest, you can spend 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, using cook's utensils and the Sample to add the corresponding Recipe that corresponds to the Sample's creature type to your Cook Book</p>
          <p class="indent"><strong><em>Preparing a Morsel.</em></strong>At the end of each short or long rest, you prepare a number of Morsels equal to your Intelligence modifier. Each Morsel you prepare has the properties of one Recipe from your Cook Book.</p>
          <p class="indent"> You don't need samples from a creature corresponding to a Recipe to prepare a Morsel with that Recipe. Any Morsels you prepare lose their potency at the end of the next short or long rest as they become inedible and bland.</p>
          <p class="indent"><strong><em>Serving Morsels.</em></strong>As an action, any creature can eat a Morsel, or feed it to a willing creature within its reach. A creature that eats a Morsel gains the benefits detailed in the Recipe description. A creature can only benefit from one Morsel at a time, and eating another Morsel instantly ends any previous Morsel benefits.</p>
          <p class="indent"><strong><em>Replacing a Cook Book.</em></strong>At the end of each short or long rest, you prepare a number of Morsels equal to your Intelligence modifier. Each Morsel you prepare has the properties of one Recipe from your Cook Book.</p>
          <p class="indent">If your Cook Book is lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 hour adding each of your old Recipes to a new Cook Book from memory. You do not need to rediscover any Recipes that were lost.</p>

  			<p>You have learned the artful and ancient magic of Runes.</p>
  			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Runes Known.</em></strong>You learn two Runes of your choice from the list at the end of this Discipline. Some Runes have a Savant level prerequisite, which you can learn as soon as you reach that Savant level.</p>
        <p class="indent">You learn one additional Rune of your choice at 6th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level in this class.</p>
        <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Runes you know with another Rune of your choice.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inscribing a Rune.</em></strong>Over the course of 1 hour, you can use your calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a Rune you know into a weapon, suit of armor, or an object that you can wear or hold. A creature that wears or wields a Runic object gains the benefits of the inscribed Rune.</p>
        <p class="indent">Each of the Runes you know can only be inscribed in one object. Inscribing a Rune again dispels any previous inscriptions.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Invoking Runes.</em></strong>If the creature bearing one of your Runic objects speaks the language the Rune is inscribed in, it can Invoke the Rune to gain its benefits.</p>
        <p class="indent">Once a Rune has been Invoked, it cannot be Invoked again until the Rune Scribe who inscribed it finishes a long rest, even if the Rune is inscribed onto a different object.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Runic Casting.</em></strong>You can cast and concentrate on spells from your Runes, even when you have a Focus. If a Rune requires a target to make a saving throw, it does so against your Intellect save DC. If a Rune requires an attack roll, the the Invoking creature uses its Intelligence as follows:</p>
        <center>
          <p><strong>Runic attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

        <p>The handle of this elegant rapier is fashioned from silver and steel, and the hollow blade is filled with ink. It bears an Elvish inscription that, when translated, reads "The pen is mightier than the sword, but this is mightier still". You gain a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.</p>
        <p class="indent">This magic rapier has 4 Charges. When you hit a target with this weapon, you can expend 1 Charge to release a blast of ink. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. This effect ends early if the creature uses its action to wipe the ink from its eyes.</p>
        <p class="indent">This magic rapier regains 1d4 Charges daily, at dawn.</p>

  			<p>Having trouble creating a personality for your Savant, or just looking for inspiration? Choose an Obsession, Eccentricity, and an Irrational Fear from the tables presented here.</p>
  			<h5>OBSESSIONS</h5>
  			<p>In their desire to answer every question, Savants can develop obsessions. These inexplicable questions and phenomena gnaw at a Savant until they find the answers that they seek.</p>
        <h5>ECCENTRICITIES</h5>
  			<p>Often, with great intellect and intense mental focus comes some strange habits. A Savant's eccentricities are usually the result of them spending too much time on their field of study.</p>
        <h5>GOOD LUCK CHARMS</h5>
  			<p>Often, despite their intellect, Savants develop attachments to mundane charms, objects, or clothing they perceive as lucky.</p>
        <h5>IRRATIONAL FEARS</h5>
  			<p>Despite their impressive minds, Savants tend to develop fears that anyone with common sense would find totally irrational.</p>
