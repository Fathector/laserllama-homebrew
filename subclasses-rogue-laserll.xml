      <p>The Infernal Legions have many soldiers, but none are more deadly then those known as Bloodknives. The elite warriors of Hell's armies, Bloodknives enhance their significant skills with infernal blood magic. By sacrificing their own vitality, they gain access to sinister abilities beyond the skill of other mortal warriors. Experts at sowing chaos and death among, their foes, Bloodknives are dispatched by the Lords of Hell only when an especially powerful foe needs to be dealt with.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, your conviction and faith allow you to produce divine spells, much like a cleric or a paladin does.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Justicar Spell List at the end of this Archetype, and you learn an additional Justicar cantrip when you reach 10th level.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Justicar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the wrathful smite spell and have both a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot, you can cast wrathful smite using either spell slot.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p class="indent">You know three 1st-level justicar spells. The Spells Known column of the Justicar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher, of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for justicar spells, as your power is fueled by belief. You use Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a justicar spell.</p>
