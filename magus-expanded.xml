      <p>You have reached the apex of your Order and are able to enchant your own Hexblade. Once you have used Sentient Bond to infuse a melee Arcane Armory weapon with a total of 100 life-essence (which can be done over the course of multiple rituals), the effects of the ritual become permanent, awakening that weapon as one of the Hexblades of myth.</p>
      <p class="indent">Once you create your Hexblade, that weapon becomes a permanent part of your Arcane Armory for as long as you live, and you cannot perform the Sentient Bond ritual on another weapon. The Hexblade's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores all increase to 16, and the Hexblade can telepathically communicate with and hear creatures within 120 feet of it.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your Hexblade also grants you the following benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attack rolls with the Hexblade against any creature under the effects of your hex spell are made with advantage.</li>
        <li>Your attacks with the Hexblade treat a target's damage immunities as resistances and ignore damage resistance.</li>
