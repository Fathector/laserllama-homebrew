    <description>
      <p>As the elderly human watched his apprentice struggle to lift the pebble with his mind, he thought back to his youth, and the years of training it had taken to unlock his own psionic gift. After traveling the world he had realized that true enlightenment was only found within, and he retreated to the cave he called home. As his remaining years had grown fewer in number, he had taken the young lad who now stood before him as an apprentice to pass on all he had learned.</p>
      <p class="indent">Selected at birth due to her psionic potential, the young elf had been molded into the perfect assassin. As held her latest mark firmly beneath her, the baron let out a soft cry as a blade of pure psionic energy pierced his heart. The next morning, the baron's guards would find him dead, though the cause of his untimely demise would forever remain a mystery.</p>
      <p class="indent">The young dwarf fled into the forest, consumed with the terror of what he'd done. For as long as he could remember, there was something within his mind that h struggled to keep bottled up. That morning, in a moment of weakness, his focus slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within him. He had awoken in the rubble of his home to find his family buried in the ruins. Deep down, he had always known this power would break free. He would live his life as a hermit in the wild where he couldn’t harm anyone else.</p>
      <h4>WONDROUS INNER POWER</h4>
      <p>Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, Psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, Psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite Wizards and devout Clerics. For Psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.</p>
      <p class="indent">Due to their potential, Psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don’t learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most Psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others.</p>
      <h4>MASTER AND APPRENTICE</h4>
      <p>If they are lucky, potential Psions are discovered by a master and taken away from their home to hone their psionic power in seclusion. No matter their philosophy on life, every Psion holds it as their sacred duty to one day take on an apprentice with the psionic gift and teach them to control their power, passing on everything they themselves have learned.</p>
      <p class="indent">A Psion's master and how they are trained has great effect on the nature of their abilities. For some, their gift is honed through years of practice and meditation. Others are trained to use their mystic abilities to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who are never discovered by a master, or attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating effects.</p>
      <h4>CREATING YOUR PSION</h4>
      <p>When creating your Psion, consider how you first discovered your psionic potential. Was it in a moment of pure emotion? Or did you realize your power through peaceful meditation? Did you have a mystical experience that awoke something asleep inside of you? Whatever your experience, the first time that a Psion realizes the true potential of their mind will have a lasting impact on how they view and wield their power.</p>
      <p class="indent">Also, consider your psionic master. Did another Psion take you under their wing, teaching you to control your wondrous power as their apprentice? Or, did you learn to wield this mysterious inner power on your own? How do you feel about your psionic gift? Is it a point of great pride? Something that separates you from the commoners? Or, do you view your gift as a curse to be hidden and used in the direst situations?</p>
      <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a Psion quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the <em>message</em> and <em>mind thrust</em> cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells <em>command</em> and <em>dissonant whispers</em>.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You have awakened the wondrous psionic potential of your mind. Beginning at 1st level, this psionic power allows you to manifest spells. See the <em>Player's Handbook</em> for the rules of Spellcasting, and the Psion spell list at the end of this class.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two Psion cantrips of your choice. You learn an additional Psion cantrip at 4th level and 10th level, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Psion table.</p>
      <h5>PSI POINTS</h5>
      <p>The psionic power of your mind is represented by a pool of Psi Points. You have a number of Psi Points equal to 1 + your Psion level. To manifest one of the Psion spells you know, you must expend a number of Psi Points equal to the level of the spell (0 for cantrips), and you regain all of your expended Psi Points each time you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, as a 3rd level Psion, you can manifest the spell <em>detect thoughts</em> at 2nd-level by spending 2 Psi Points.</p>
      <h5>MENTAL LIMIT</h5>
      <p>Your Psion level limits the potency of spells you can manifest with your psionics. This limit is reflected in the Mental Limit column of the Psion Table. If a Psion class feature is limited by your Mental Limit, you can't expend more Psi Points than it would cost to manifest a spell of your Mental Limit level.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, a 5th level Psion is limited to learning and manifesting Psion spells of 3rd-level or lower.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Psion spell list at the end of this class. The Spells Known column of the Psion table shows when you learn more Psion spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level equal to your Mental Limit or lower, as shown on the Psion table. For instance, upon reaching 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new Psion spell of either 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
      <p class="indent">When you gain a Psion level, you can replace one of your Psion Spells Known with another Psion spell of your choice.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells since your magic is drawn from the power of your mind. You use your Intelligence when a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when you set the saving throw DC or make an attack roll for a Psion spell.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>Your mind is the spellcasting focus for your Psion spells. You must have a free hand to cast spells that require somatic or material components, and you must still provide any material components that are consumed or have a required gold cost.</p>
      <p class="indent">When you manifest a spell with your psionics, you exhibit noticeable changes. Whether your eyes glow with the light of the otherworldly far realm, or your body partially phases into the astral plane, creatures are aware that you are using your psionics unless a feature says otherwise.</p>

          <p>In times of great need, you can draw upon your life force to manifest psionic power. Starting at 10th level, whenever you would expend Psi Points to manifest a Psion spell or use a Psion feature, you can expend your hit points instead. When you do, reduce your current and maximum hit points by twice the number of Psi Points you normally expend. This reduction cannot be lessened in any way. A reduction to your maximum hit points from this feature returns to normal when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>By far the most volatile Psions, Wilders are those who never truly learn to control the wondrous power of their mind. They often discover their psionic abilities unexpectedly as a result of a traumatic event or violently manifest their mystic power after years of attempting to contain it. Wilders are as erratic as they are powerful and rarely have psionic masters. By the time these uncontrolled abilities develop, it is often too late to gain control of the torrent of psionic power within them.</p>
