      <p>Not all Fighters rely solely on themselves in battle, some use their knowledge of battlefield tactics to command their allies. Commanders are warriors who lead their soldiers from the front, issuing Orders and inspiring greatness in others with their own brave deeds. By their presence, a Commander can transform an unorganized militia into a deadly force.</p>

      <p>Guardians are elite defensive warriors whose strengths shine while fighting side by side with their allies. Though trained to use weapons of all types, Guardians are especially effective when using a protective style of fighting with a weapon and shield. Alone, a Guardian is a small threat, but when fighting alongside their allies they are impenetrable walls of steel.</p>

        <p>You have completed the training of a Loyal Hound. Your Hound is friendly to you and obeys commands. It uses the Loyal Hound stat block, that uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>
        <p class="indent">In combat, your Hound acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but it only takes the Dodge action unless you use your bonus action to command it to take an action from its stat block, or another action. When you take the Attack action, you can command your Hound to take the Attack action in place of one of your attacks. If you are incapacitated, your Loyal Hound can act on its own to defend you.</p>
        <p class="indent">If your Hound is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws like a player character would. If your Hound dies, your skills allow you to find a canine-like creature and train it as a Loyal Hound over the course of a long rest, at which point, that creature uses the Loyal Hound stat block.</p>

        <p>In your study of the sword you have mastered other skills adjacent to swordplay. You gain proficiency in your choice of Acrobatics, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.</p>
        <p class="indent">You also learn to utilize special Maneuvers to enhance your martial skill in battle. You gain the following features:</p>
        <p class="indent"><b><em>Maneuvers.</em></b> You learn three Maneuvers of your choice from those available to the Battle Master. You can use only one Maneuver per attack. You learn another Maneuver of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level in this class.</p>
        <p class="indent"><b><em>Superiority Dice.</em></b> You have four Superiority Dice, which are d6s for you. To use one of the Maneuvers you know, you must expend a Superiority Die as part of your attack. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain a fifth Superiority Die at 10th level and a final sixth Superiority Die 18th level.</p>
        <p class="indent"><b><em>Saving Throws.</em></b> Some Maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the Maneuver's effects. Your Maneuver saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
        <center>
          <p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>

Rather than master martial techniques they look to augment their physical ability with mechanical inventions and innovative weaponry. Though they spend most of their time theorizing, tinkering, and experimenting with new Schematics, Tinker Knights and their inventive arsenals are a force to be reckoned with when they take to the field.</p>
