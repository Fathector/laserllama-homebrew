      <p>For those with the willpower and time, arcane magic can be a path to great power. Those who ascend to these lofty heights of arcane power are known as Archmages, masters of the weave. So wondrous is their power, and so strange are their goals, these masters of magic will sometimes enlist warlocks to help with, what appear to the Archmage, to be trivial tasks.</p>

      <p>The power granted by your Patron allows you to prevent the unworthy from approaching you or anything you stand guard over. Beginning at 1st level, you can use an action to project a small but powerful magical Ward outward from yourself, with a radius in feet equal to five times your proficiency bonus.</p>
      <p class="indent">When a hostile creature enters the area of your Ward, or starts its turns within it, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw in order to move. On a success, it can move, but it treats the area within your Ward as difficult terrain. On a failure, it cannot move into, or within, the area of your Ward.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your Ward lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you end it as a bonus action or you are incapacitated. Once used, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use the Ward again.</p>
