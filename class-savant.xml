        <description>
    <p>An elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak as the dust settled. The emperor had paid her a handsome sum to locate this forgotten place, and after months of poring over ancient maps, she had pieced together the once-lost location of the primeval temple. Now, she had a decision to make. If she reported the location of the temple to her benefactor, it would be stripped of its valuables. But, if she kept the location to herself, she could preserve the ancient knowledge contained within. For a savant, knowledge is more precious than any sum of gold.</p>
    <p class="indent">An aging human warrior silently assessed the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth night of a brutal siege, and the graying commander knew that no reinforcements were coming to their rescue. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders without any hesitation, they might have a chance of survival. He stood up, and for what could very well be the last time, drew his weathered sword from its scabbard.</p>
    <p class="indent">A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shook as he examined his brother's wounds. His clan had a small fortune sending him to study at the finest university in the land. All those hours spent in lectures and libraries, all for this moment. He thought back to all his lessons and began to dress his brother's wounds.</p>
    <h4>MAGNIFICENT MINDS</h4>
    <p>There are many wonderfully intelligent people in the world, but few are true Savants. Born with the innate desire to learn anything they can, and the potential for genius-level intellect, Savants spend their lives learning anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognizable at an early age, a Savant's unquenchable hunger for knowledge draws them to the great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. They are willing to go to any lengths to unlock the secrets of the world, often turning to lives of adventure. For a Savant, no price is too steep for the promise of discovery.</p>
    <h4>INTENSELY FOCUSED</h4>
    <p>Savants are hyper-focused on their chosen area of study and often become obsessed with learning all they can about their specialty. In their quest for discovery, Savants are willing to set aside any conviction, political, religious, or otherwise, to acquire the information they seek. To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to any ideology.</p>
    <p class="indent">Often at great personal cost, Savants will not stop their research until they have made a revolutionary discovery in their area of study. It is not unusual to encounter one such scholar far from the safety of a university and its libraries.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A SAVANT</h4>
    <p>When creating a Savant, consider their upbringing and the level of their formal education. Were they a star pupil at the finest university gold could buy? Or, were they a child of the streets, fighting for every scrap of knowledge that they could get their hands on? Maybe their mind was trained from birth to be the perfect analytical tool for a noble house or family.</p>
    <p class="indent">Also, consider why your Savant would rely on only their intellect rather than use their gifts in pursuit of the arcane or in the service of a higher power. Are they cursed to never be able to produce even the most mundane spell? Or, have they sworn never to rely on the magic that destroyed their family?</p>
    <p class="indent">Finally, why did your Savant become an adventurer rather than live the life of an academic? Have they advanced beyond normal study and look forward to the endless discoveries of adventure? Or, have they always been a student of the world?</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a Savant quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by your Dexterity. Second, choose the Noble background.</p>

            <p>You can focus your mind to analyze your foe. Beginning at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to analyze one creature you can see within 60 feet, designating it as your Focus. While it is your Focus, you gain the following benefits against it:</p>

            <h5 class="caption">INTELLECT DIE</h5>
      			<p>These increased analytical abilities are represented by your Intellect Die, which begins as a d6. You start knowing three such features that make use of the Intellect Die: Calculated Flourish, Potent Observation, and Wondrous Insight.</p>
